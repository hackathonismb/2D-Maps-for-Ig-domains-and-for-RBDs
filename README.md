1. What is the problem? 

**Understanding 3D protein structure within 2D space.** 1D protein sequence can be informative; however, the topological information is completely missing. 3D structures provide structual annotation and provides visualization of domain interactions but without the amino acid residue information. 2D visualizations provide both sequence information and 3D structual annotations, which allows biologists to quickly interpret function. 

2. Why is it significant? 

Ig domains are an important component of the immune system. They recognize foreign antigens, bind the receptor binding domain (RBD), and clears the antigen from the system. IgV domains are particularly important due to the variable region, which can bind new antigens and RBDs. Visualizing the domain folds and RBD binding in a 2D map will provide insight into regions of gaps or mutations preventing the immune system from recognizing pathogens. 2D maps will provide a tool to identify therapuetic targets.
